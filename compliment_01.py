'''

1. On a scale of 1 to 10 (where 10 is the hardest), how would you rate this lab?

I would rate this a 1


2. What was the hardest part of this lab?

The hardest part of this lab was just thinking about how there only needs to be one conditional
because all other conditions result in the same output from the program.
